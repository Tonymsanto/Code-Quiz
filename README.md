# Code-Quiz
This project we needed to have a quiz that had a timer on the start of the quiz, and seconds were deducted when you got answers wrong. After the time or questions run out, you should be able to put in your initials and it store the scores. This is the project that made me realize that I need to really step up my studying. After working for hours, writing code, erasing code, re-writing code, I came up with a somewhat fuctional quiz, and a not really working timer. This is a humbling project and I know I will put in the hours in to studying from now on, so I won't have troubles on future projects like this.
